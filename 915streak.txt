can you guide me to build this strategy on streak ?

Strategy - 
I want to use a custom straddle strategy where I will not take the long positions immediately, but wait for certain conditions before taking the positions - 

Entry conditions - 
 At 09:30 AM note down the price of ATM call and ATM put option.
after every 15 mins, check the price of each leg. 
if the price of any leg has increased by 15% from the price noted at 09:30 AM, buy one lot.
we only buy once in a day

Exit conditions - 
Close the open leg at 03:15 PM irrespective of PNL.
set the SL at 20% of the buy price.
set the target at 50%.
